I am a 2nd-year MAM undergraduate student at University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).

My primary interests lie at the intersection of mathematical theory and practical applications, especially in **Robotics** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

I am passionate about robotics **whole-body object interaction** and how to **rollout data learning** from real world for robotics. 

* **Core Coursework:** Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Real Analysis, Group theory, Number Theory.
* **Interests:** Robotics, AI, Real Analysis.

Feel free to reach out to me for discussions or potential collaborations!
