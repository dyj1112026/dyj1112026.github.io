Hi there! I am Yujing Deng, a Mathematics and Applied Mathmatics Undergrad student at University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).

My primary interests lie at the intersection of mathematical theory and practical applications. I am particularly passionate about exploring probability distributions, linear algebra, and how these foundational theories can be applied to build intelligent systems in **Robotics** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

Currently, I am actively expanding my knowledge in algorithms , aiming to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and real-world technological solutions. 

* **Core Coursework:** Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Real Analysis, Group theory, Number Theory.
* **Interests:** Robotics, AI, Real Analysis.

Besides, I am also interested in calligraphy and piano, enjoying the beauty of art.Also,I enjoy hiking, and I also enjoy the challenges that come along the way – and I take pleasure in overcoming them.  

Feel free to reach out to me for discussions or potential collaborations!
